<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install, use your favorite package manager and do the equivalent of:

```sh
pip install vref-utils
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

### Usage

```python
from vref_utils import Vref

niv = Vref("./en-NIV11.txt")

jhn3v16 = niv["JHN 3:16"][0]
print(jhn3v16)
# For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
```

Note that `__get_item__` (the function called by `niv["JHN 3:16"]`) returns a `VerseList`. The `VerseList` class allows us to iterate through the verses using a generator, but we can also access elements using indices or slices. Here, we use `[0]` to get the first (and only) `Verse`.

```python
print(repr(jhn3v16))
# Verse(verse="JHN 3:16", text="For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.")
```

The `Verse` class supports the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods. So casting the first element to a string by printing it prints the text. You can also return the verse text using the `.text` attribute. Likewise, you can get the verse reference using the `.reference` attribute.

```python
print(jhn3v16.text)
# For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

print(jhn3v16.reference)
# JHN 3:16
```

Printing the reference is not useful when there is only one verse, but you can select multiple verses using ranges like "JHN 3:16-JHN 3:17" or selections like "JHN 3:16,JHN 3:17" or a combination of both like "JHN 3:16,JHN 3:17-JHN 3:18".

```python
print(niv["JHN 3:16-JHN 3:17,JHN 3:18"])
# VerseList([
#   Verse(verse="JHN 3:16", text="For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,..."),
#   Verse(verse="JHN 3:17", text="For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the wo..."),
#   Verse(verse="JHN 3:18", text="Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does no...")
# ])
```

**Note:**

- Book names must be valid USFM book names.
- Chapter and verse numbers must be valid.
- Books and chapters must be specified in full for ranges/selections.
  - ❌ `JHN 1:1-2`
  - ❌ `JHN 1:1-1:2`
  - ✅ `JHN 1:1-JHN 1:2`
- May include multiple ranges/selections separated by ",".
  - ✅ `JHN 1:1-JHN 1:2,JHN 1:4`

### Custom Versification Formats

By default, the `org` versification system is used (and packaged in `vref-utils`). If you have vref files that use a different versification system, you can specify it when creating the `Vref` object.

```python
from vref_utils import Vref

niv = Vref("./en-NIV11.txt", "custom_vref.txt")
# or, with named arguments:
niv = Vref("./en-MYBIBLE.txt", versification_vref_path="custom_vref.txt")
```
